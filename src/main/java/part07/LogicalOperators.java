//        logical operators start at about 80:43 — stop at about 87:47
// Guide: GUIDE.md in this folder, steps 1–6
//
// Part 07 — the logical operators: && (and), || (or), ! (not)
//
// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this class.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called LogicalOperators.
//    Leave the "package part07;" line and the "public class LogicalOperators" line alone.
//    The import line goes BETWEEN them (the guide shows where).
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does. The README shows an example.

public class LogicalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int temp = 20;
        if (temp >= 80) {
            System.out.println("It is hot outside");
        }
        else if (temp >= 60 && temp <= 70) {
            System.out.println("It is warm outside");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("It is cold outside");
        }
    }
